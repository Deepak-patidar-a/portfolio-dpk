        "A full-stack trading platform inspired by Zerodha - featuring live candlestick charts rendered on Canvas at 60fps, a real-time order book powered by WebSockets, and an AI trade signal engine using the Claude API. Designed to demonstrate senior-level frontend architecture: off-thread computation via Web Workers, normalized Redux state for surgical re-renders, and a natural language query interface. Fully documented with an interactive architecture plan and a 4-lesson learning path covering every core concept before a single line was written.",
